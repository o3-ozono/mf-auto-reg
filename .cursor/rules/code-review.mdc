# Code Review Guidelines

## General Guidelines

- PR titles should follow [Conventional Commits](mdc:https:/www.conventionalcommits.org) format defined in `basic.mdc`
- Each PR should address a single concern
- Large PRs should be broken down into smaller, focused PRs when possible
- The PR description should explain what changes were made and why
- Link to related issues using GitHub's issue linking syntax (e.g., "Closes #123")

## Reviewer Responsibilities

- Reviewers should respond to PRs within 24 hours
- Focus on:
  - Code correctness (does it work as intended?)
  - Code quality (is it maintainable, readable, and performant?)
  - Test coverage (are scenarios covered as per `development.mdc`?)
  - Security (are there any security concerns as per `basic.mdc`?)
  - Documentation (is the code documented as per `development.mdc`?)

## Code Review Checklist

### Functionality
- [ ] Does the code work as expected?
- [ ] Does it handle edge cases and error conditions?
- [ ] Are there any race conditions or performance issues?

### Code Quality
- [ ] Does the code follow project style guidelines?
- [ ] Is the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
- [ ] Is the code maintainable and easy to understand?
- [ ] Are functions and classes properly modularized?

### Testing (Refer to `development.mdc` for strategy)
- [ ] Are there appropriate tests?
- [ ] Do the tests cover edge cases?
- [ ] Is the test coverage sufficient (e.g., >= 80% for core)?
- [ ] Do all tests pass?
- [ ] Are E2E tests present for user-facing features?
- [ ] Do E2E tests cover the workflow and error scenarios?

### Security (Refer to `basic.mdc` for guidelines)
- [ ] Are inputs properly validated?
- [ ] Are sensitive data handled properly?
- [ ] Are there any potential security vulnerabilities?

### Documentation (Refer to `development.mdc` for guidelines)
- [ ] Are functions, classes, and interfaces properly documented (TSDoc)?
- [ ] Is the documentation clear and accurate?
- [ ] Are README or other project documents updated if needed?

## Common Pitfalls to Watch For

### Node Implementation
- Missing error handling in async functions
- Improper context object manipulation
- Using hardcoded values instead of configuration parameters
- Not following the single responsibility principle

### Workflow Definitions
- Ambiguous or missing node connections
- Conditions that don't handle all cases
- Lack of error handling paths

### Database Operations
- Missing validation before database operations
- Not using parameterized queries
- Overly complex queries that could be simplified

### Browser Automation
- Fragile selectors that might break with UI changes
- Missing waits for page elements to load
- Not handling potential timeouts or failures
- Insufficient error recovery in E2E test flows
- Not properly isolating test data between test runs
- Missing cleanup of test resources after tests complete

## Review Process

1. Reviewer assigns themselves to the PR
2. Reviewer provides feedback using GitHub's review features
3. Author addresses feedback and requests re-review
4. Process repeats until all concerns are addressed
5. Reviewer approves the PR
6. Author or reviewer merges the PR after
